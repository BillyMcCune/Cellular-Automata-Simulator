/**
 * Goal: how to encapsulate the implementation details while encouraging changes (extensions for as many different kinds of features as possible)
 * Such as: between the backend and frontend (e.g., between programmers in a project's other sub-groups to allow them to develop independently and in parallel)
 * Such as: between a platform and completely external developers (e.g., between iOS and app developers or between Unity and game developers)
 * Contract: what services can you provide to encourage other programmers to build their own new functionality?
 * How do you plan to encapsulate them from implementation changes?
 * What objects will be used for communication, making clear:
 * how needed information will be delivered to where it is needed
 * what will be abstractions
 * what errors may be thrown
 * what things will be immutable
 * how to make the process as active as possible (not just giving out raw data)
